# About the Adopt-A-Pet Website
Adopt-A-Pet is a react web app that allows users to:
- browse pets by category
- search for pets by keyword
- view a pet's profile page
- navigate back through user history

This project was built for [Codecademy's React Router course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-react-router) to practice `react-router-dom`. Codecademy retains copyright of the web design, assets and starter code, while I added the routing.
